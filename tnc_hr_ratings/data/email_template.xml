                        <p>The performance review process is in full flow now, and we hope the employees under you have begun to submit their self-evaluation forms.</p>
                        <br/>

                        <p>This is a friendly reminder that you have ${ctx.get('no_of_days') or ''} days until ${ctx.get('last_date') or ''} to review their self-evaluation. Please schedule an appointment with the employees individually to discuss their self-evaluation performance review and meet with their team members to evaluate the employee in review directly.</p>
                        <br/>

                        <p>If you have any questions or there's anything at all you're unclear about, don't hesitate to get in touch with me directly.</p>
